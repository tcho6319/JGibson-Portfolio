5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
    Note that everyone will do both front-end and back-end. See design journey for more detailed distribution of work for implementation.

    - Client Liason (Shea Murphy): Communicates with the client directly. Organizes meetings with the client for updates on the website.

    - We will talk to the member directly but respectfully


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
    - When we disagree, we will hold a vote between the members of the team. If we have a tie, we will ask the client to break the tie for us so that we do not have to discuss further.

    - Whenever we disagree or have a conflict, we will look over this contract for guidance. And if we feel that it needs to be revised, we will do so.


10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
    - We will get cookies when we are done with the project. Treat Yo Self.


## How to Use This Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
