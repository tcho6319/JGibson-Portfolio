## Client Description

Our client is a freelance artist named Jennifer Gibson.

## Meeting Notes

In-person meeting with client: 4/15/19

Purpose of Client's Website (Like a portfolio):

- Children's illustration work to show to art directors
  - Art directors mostly in NY. Working in print publishing for children's illustrations and smaller publishers.
- To showcase older pieces for purchase
  - Local people
  - Galleries
- Commissions
  - Local people
  - Galleries

- Clean, white background. Put focus on the art work.
- Likes idea of filtering gallery images. Would like to keep the categories she has on her squarespace site. For example, her illustrations category is specifically geared toward art directors for potetntial children's illustration work.
- Likes the form ideas
- Concerns: Image size and resolution. Would like good resolution for images and sizes that would be appropriate (i.e. so that user would not have to scroll to see the entire piece).
- We should give client ability to delete her images
- Client will send content/images, possibly login so we can access her squarespace site, and details about her pieces (title, date, description like what media she used).

- Theresa's question to the rest of the group: Should we give the client the option to edit the title, date, description of a single image? This is in case she adds an image where her description has a typo or something.

## Purpose & Content

Our client requested that we make her a new, improved website that could serve as a gallery for her artwork, as well as a way to attract potential clients. This would mean that our website's content would include her art, details about her art (i.e. title, date, media, whether or not it is available for purchase), information regarding her previous projects, and forms to allow her to upload her new art and a contact/art request form.

## Target Audience(s)

Based on our meeting with the client, there are three main target audiences.

The first target audience is art directors interested in childrens illustration work. Most of these art directors would live in NY. They would interact with the site to see her work and decide if they would like to publish it.

The second target audience is local people and galleries who may be interested in showcasing the client's older pieces for purchase. They would interact with the site similarly to the directors by viewing her portfolio and decided if they would like to showcase her work.

The third target audience would be local people/galleries who want to buy art directly from the client. Rather than viewing the website for publishing or showcasing purposes, they would be deciding if they are interested in buying her work for themselves.

All of the target audiences would find the client's website through her referral to the site. They would interact with it on a personal or work computer to view the client's artwork and learn a bit about the artist. The client hopes to use the website as a portfolio.

## Client Requirements & Target Audiences' Needs

- Client requirement
  - **Requirement**
    - Client wants a clean, white background in order to not distract from her artwork
  - **Design Ideas & Choices**
    - We will adhere to the client's wishes by making the background white and creating a minimalist look.
  - **Rationale**
    - The client wants the focus to be on her art work. She doesn't want the target audience to be distracted by the design of the website and take away from its purpose.

- Client Requirement
  - **Requirement**
    - The client wants to make sure that each image is the appropriate size and resolution.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will design the website so that the user can view each image on their browser without having to scroll up/down to view the image.
  - **Rationale**
    - Make the images a good size so that the target audience can consume them, but not too big that they are longer than the length of the website page. Minimize horizontal & vertical scrolling to further enhance the professional look of the website.

- Client Requirement
  - **Requirement**
    - The client wants to be able to edit images in her gallery (e.g. be able to delete an image, send an image, have titles/dates/descriptions of media)
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will design the website so that when the client uploads an image she can add a title, date, and description of the media. In addition, after uploading she should be able to edit these pieces of information about the image.
  - **Rationale**
    - The client should be able to justify her artwork ongoing, so she should be able to edit her description of the image. Another example may be if a piece wins an award and she wants to mention that in the image description. Also, since the client is a freelancer, she needs to be able to showcase her works herself after we deliver the product to her. The client does not have a webmaster so the website should be accessible to her, especially when she wants to add works or modify details of her works.


Target Audience Needs for All Three Target Audiences
- Target Audience Need
  - **Need**
    - Client wants to filter gallery images the way they are currently filtered on her website. Filtering helps the target audience by making it easier to find the type of art they are looking for.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will have four separate galleries for her 4 different styles - outdoor, portraits,  illustration, and personal.
    - We will create buttons for the 4 different styles to help filter the gallery.
  - **Rationale**
    - The target audiences will likely have 1/4 styles in their mind when visiting the client's website, so we will make it simple for them to find the type of art they're looking for.
    - Since the target audience would be working professionals or local people/galleries, they may be older and not want to bother with complicated filtering. Therefore, having buttons that in essence do a filter search specific to the 4 different style categories will aid in simple usability.

- Target Audience Need
  - **Need**
    - Art Directors are busy filtering through different artists for children's illustrations. They will have to work through a high volume of applicants in a limited amount of time.
    - Local people or galleries that may want to showcase or purchase certain art pieces may already want a specific type of piece, and they may not have the time to go through the client's whole gallery of works.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will include an additional element to the search bar for the gallery so that the user can look up a keyword in the description field. For example, if a user entered "underwater" because they wanted to see if the client did any underwater pieces to see her technique (maybe for art directors) or if they specifically wanted to showcase or purchase an underwater piece, any pieces that have the word "underwater" in the description will show up in the search results.
    - If there are no pieces that correspond to the search term, then there will be a message that directs the user to a contact form to show that the client would be willing to work with the user to create the style of work the user was looking for.
    - We will allow the user to flip through single image views of all search results (if a search was made) or all works (default).
  - **Rationale**
    - The text input field for a keyword search in addition to the tag search will further expedite the process of browsing for the busy target audiences. Since the purpose of the site is to engage the target audience's interest in the hopes of encouraging contact between the client and the target audience, adding this convenient way to filter the gallery would be helpful for busy users.
    - Adding a message that directs the target audience to a contact form in case there are no search results for the keyword search further helps maintain contact between the client and the target audience. Since the client is using this site to get projects, it would be in her best interest to redirect the target audience to an alternative of reaching out to her directly if they want to view a specific style of art rather than simply showing that she does not have the work.
    - Flip through single image views: By having buttons on the left and right side of a single image view, a user can look through the single image views of search results or the whole gallery quickly without having to go back to the grid form and clicking on the next piece to see it in single image view.

Target Audience Need for Local People and Galleries
- Target Audience Need
  - **Need**
    - Want to purchase the client's art.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will include another filter button called "Available" that, when clicked, would show the pieces that the client would like to sell.
    - On the Gallery page, we will include a message that directs the user to the contact page if they would like to purchase a piece.
    - We will not list the price of the piece.
  - **Rationale**
    - The filter button creates a more personalized experience for target audience members who solely wish to purchase the client's work so that they do not have to unnecessarily browse through her art and guess whether or not a piece is on sale.
    - The message on the Gallery page guides the process of requesting to purchase a piece by directing the user to the contact/purchase form. By having the message right on the page where the gallery is, the user would see the instructions easily and know how to request an available piece.
    - We did not list the price of the piece in case the client would like to negotiate a price with a potential buyer.

## Work Distribution

[Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.]

## Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]

All of the content (both images and text) we plan on using has been provided on her current website, <https://www.jgibsonillustration.com>. However, outside of some organizational structures, we will be completely redesigning her website from scratch.

Here are screenshots of the client's original website:

## Client Feedback

[Share the feedback notes you received from your client about your initial design.]
- Our client's only feedback was that she wanted "gallery" page before "about" page in the navigarion bar.

## Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected Abby as my persona.

I've selected my persona because Abby has the hardest time adapting to new technology. It is important that we don't assume the users of our client's website, or our client herself, are technologically adapted.

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 2 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: Edit the title of an image in the gallery

  1. Log in
  2. Go to gallery page
  3. Delete current image
  4. Re-add the image to the gallery, changing it's title

Task 2: Contact the artist for purchasing inquiry

  1. Go to contact page
  2. Fill out form
  3. Submit form

### Cognitive Walkthrough

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

**Task name: Edit the title of an image in the gallery**

**Subgoal #1 : Log in**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why?
      Abby will know that she has to log in to make changes to the gallery because it is a feature only people with authority have access to.

**Action #1A : Fill out username and password**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Abby would have been given a username and password in order to login, so she will be able to complete this step.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      Abby knows her login information and filling out a login form for a website is something she is already confident in because it is a functionality of many websites.

**Action #1B : Click submit**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
    The submit button for the log in form is clear, so Abby will know she has to click it to complete her log in.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
    There will no longer be a log in form in the footer once she is done logging in. To make this more clear, it might help to add a "log out" button in our sketches.

**Subgoal #2 : Go to the gallery page**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why?
      Abby has low confidence, but one of her first actions will likely be to check the navigation bar to find out where she can complete her task. The gallery would be an instinctive choice to edit images.

**Action #2A : Click on gallery on navigation**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Abby knows that she needs to edit an image that is in the gallery, so once she sees the navigation her choice would be to go to the gallery page
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      Abby will see the gallery page and know she is in the right place because it contains all of the images in the gallery and a place to edit the images.

**Subgoal #3 : Delete the current image**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why?
      Abby might hope there would be an edit button for images. Once she sees there isn't one, she might get nervous that she didn't find it. She may either give up or realize she can delete an image and then add it again in order to change the title.


**Action #3A : Select image**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: no
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Our sketches don't make it clear how to select an image.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      If Abby finds a way to select the image, she will know it is selected and proceed to delete it.

**Action #3B : Click delete image**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      There is a clear "delete painting" button which Abby will know to click in order to delete the image.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      The image will be deleted from the gallery, so Abby will know it is gone.

**Subgoal #4 : Re-add the image to the gallery, changing it's title**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why?
      If Abby knew to delete the image in the previous subgoal, she will know to add a new image. If she didn't, she might already be lost.

**Action #4A : Click on add a new painting**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      The button for "add a new painting" is clear and Abby will know to click on it.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      There will be a window to select the image Abby wants to add. She will then select the image.

**Action #4B : Enter a title and tag**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Abby will know she needs to add a title and tags to her image, and she will see the form next to the "add a new painting" button she just completed. She might get confused by the search bar above this part of the form.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      She will be able to see that she entered a title and tags.


**Action #4B : Upload image**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: no
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      There is no submit button currently in our sketch.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: no
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      It is impossible for her to complete this action without the submit button, so we need to add that.

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough

**Task name: Contact the artist for purchasing inquiry**

**Subgoal #1 : Go to contact page**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why?
      Abby knows she has to contact the artist in order to purchase her artwork, so it would be natural for her to go to the contact page. She may first check out the about page to see if there is any information about purchasing there. We may want to add some info there.

**Action #1A : Click on contact page**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      As stated, she may be conflicted between the about and contact page.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      She will see the form for contacting the artist and know she is in the right place.

**Subgoal #2 : Fill out form**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why?
      Once Abby gets to the contact page, she will see the form and know to complete it in order to let the artist know she wants to purchase something.

**Action #2A : Choose a reason from dropdown**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Her options will be for purchase or general inquiry. She wants to buy artwork, so she will select purchase.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      She will see that she selected "purchasing" from the dropdown.

**Action #2B : Fill out rest of form**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Abby is used to completing tasks, and this form is a simple task. She will know how to fill it out.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: yes
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      She will see her progress and what she has typed into the form.

**Subgoal #3 : Submit form**
  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: no
    - Why?
      There is no submit button on our sketches currently

**Action #2B : Click submit button**
  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: no
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      There currently isn't a submit button for the form.
  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: maybe
    - Why? (Especially consider [persona name]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
      If there is confirmation after submitting the form, Abby will know what she did is right.

### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How will you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

There were a few functionality issues with our design.

First, we realized that we need to include a log out button when the user is logged it. This will confirm for the user that they are logged in.

Next, it was confusing for the persona that the images didn't seem to have a select button in order to delete the image. We will implement that as well so that the user can easily see they need to select the image in order to delete it.

We also realized that the search bar next to the form for adding the image is confusing. It would make more sense for the search bar to be its own entity and not connected/so close to the form.

There were also issues with sketching the submit button for our forms. Submitting is a crucial part of implementing forms, so we need to fix our sketches.

We also realized that a persona like Abby may be confused as to where she should go to make a purchase from the artist. To make this more clear, we will add information in the about page that says users should go to "contact" page and fill it out if they wish to purchase artwork.

Finally, we need to make sure that users have confirmation of submitting the contact form. User feedback for submitting forms is imperative.

[Your responses here should be **very** thorough and thoughtful.]



## Final Design

[Include sketches of your finalized design.]

[What changes did you make to your final design based on the results on your cognitive walkthrough?]


## Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

```
user (
id : INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
name : TEXT {Not}
username : TEXT {Not}
password : TEXT {Not}
)

images (
id : INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
filename : TEXT {Not}
ext : TEXT {Not}
description : TEXT
user_id : INTEGER {Not}
)

tags (
id : INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
tag : TEXT {Not}
)

image_tags (
id : INTEGER {PK, U, Not, AI}
tag_id : TEXT {Not}
image_id : TEXT {Not}
)
```


## Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]


## PHP File Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - home page.
* about.php - about page.
* gallery.php - gallery page.
* contact.php - contact (and also upload) page.
* singleimage.php - page used to view an image in fullscreen.

## Final Notes to the Clients

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]


## Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]
