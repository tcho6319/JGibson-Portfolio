## Client Description

Our client is a freelance artist named Jennifer Gibson.

## Meeting Notes

In-person meeting with client: 4/15/19

Purpose of Client's Website (Like a portfolio):

- Children's illustration work to show to art directors
  - Art directors mostly in NY. Working in print publishing for children's illustrations and smaller publishers.
- To showcase older pieces for purchase
  - Local people
  - Galleries
- Commissions
  - Local people
  - Galleries

- Clean, white background. Put focus on the art work.
- Likes idea of filtering gallery images. Would like to keep the categories she has on her squarespace site. For example, her illustrations category is specifically geared toward art directors for potetntial children's illustration work.
- Likes the form ideas
- Concerns: Image size and resolution. Would like good resolution for images and sizes that would be appropriate (i.e. so that user would not have to scroll to see the entire piece).
- We should give client ability to delete her images
- Client will send content/images, possibly login so we can access her squarespace site, and details about her pieces (title, date, description like what media she used).

- Theresa's question to the rest of the group: Should we give the client the option to edit the title, date, description of a single image? This is in case she adds an image where her description has a typo or something.

## Purpose & Content

Our client requested that we make her a new, improved website that could serve as a gallery for her artwork, as well as a way to attract potential clients. This would mean that our website's content would be her art as well as information regarding her previous projects, and forms to allow her to upload her new art and a contact/ art request form.

## Target Audience(s)

Based on our meeting with the client, there are three main target audiences.

The first target audience is art directors interested in childrens illustration work. Most of these art directors would live in NY. They would interact with the site to see her work and decide if they would like to publish it.

The second target audience is local people and galleries who may be interested in showcasing the client's older pieces for purchase. They would interact with the site similarly to the directors by viewing her portfolio and decided if they would like to showcase her work.

The third target audience would be local people/galleries who want to buy art directly from the client. Rather than viewing the website for publishing or showcasing purposes, they would be deciding if they are interested in buying her work for themselves.

All of the target audiences would find the client's website through her referral to the site. They would interact with it on a personal or work computer to view the clients artwork and learn a bit about the artist. The client hopes to use the website as a portfolio.

## Client Requirements & Target Audiences' Needs

- Client requirement
  - **Requirement**
    - Client wants a clean, white background in order to not distract from her artwork
  - **Design Ideas & Choices**
    - We will adhere to the clients wishes by making the background white and creating a minimalist look.
  - **Rationale**
    - The client wants the focus to be on her art work. She doesn't want the target audience to be distracted by the design of the website and take away from its purpose.

- Target Audience Need
  - **Need**
    - Client wants to filter gallery images the way they are currently filtered on her website. Filtering helps the target audience by making it easier to find the type of art they are looking for.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will have four separate galleries for her 4 different styles - outdoor, portraits,  illustration, and personal.
  - **Rationale**
    - The target audiences will likely have 1/4 styles in their mind when visiting the client's website, so we will make it simple for them to find the type of art they're looking for.

- Client Requirement
  - **Requirement**
    - The client wants to make sure that each image is the appropriate size and resolution.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will design the website so that the user can view each image on their browser without having to scroll up/down to view the image.
  - **Rationale**
    - Make the images a good size so that the target audience can consume them, but not too big that they are longer than the length of the website page.

- Client Requirement
  - **Requirement**
    - The client wants to be able to edit images in her gallery (e.g. be able to delete an image, send an image, have titles/dates/descriptions of media)
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - We will design the website so that when the client uploads an image she can add a title, date, and description of the media. In addition, after uploading she should be able to edit these pieces of information about the image.
  - **Rationale** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - The client should be able to justify her artwork ongoing, so she should be able to edit her description of the image. Another example may be if a piece wins a reward and she wants to mention that in the image description.

## Work Distribution

[Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.]

  - Home/About Page + Login/Logout/Sessions
  - Gallery + Query String Parameter â†’ viewing a single image on a page

## Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]

All of the content (both images and text) we plan on using has been provided on her current website, <https://www.jgibsonillustration.com>. However, outside of some organizational structures, we will be completely redesigning her website from scratch.

## Iterated Design

[Improve your design based on the feedback you received from your client.]


## Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Abby/Patricia/Patrick/Tim]** as my persona.

I've selected my persona because... [Tell us why you picked your persona in 1-3 sentences. Your explanation should include why your persona will help you address gender-inclusiveness bugs in your design.]

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 2 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

Task 1: [describe your task]

  1. [action 1...]
  2. [action 2...]
  3. ...

Task 2:


### Cognitive Walkthrough

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]


#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough

## Final Design

[Include sketches of your finalized design.]

[What changes did you make to your final design based on the results on your cognitive walkthrough?]
